# How Dubber is solving the business compliance barrier!

## Compliance obligations are forcing institutions to not only record conversations with customers, but also search the recorded data for potential breaches of the law. A change in regulation by the ACCC in telecommunications industry to record all their inbound call centre traffic ignited the spark in Dubber’s Co-Founders Steve McGovern (CEO), James Slaney (COO), and Adrian Di Pietrantonio (EVP).  They were working with an Australian Service Provider who had committed to the ACCC (Australian regulator) to record all their in-bound call centre traffic. came up with the idea over a few glasses of wine. From their experience hey realised that it is very expensive to record conversation and retrieve data. They saw the technology opportunity, did something novel in call recording, and built the entire global-scale platform by making it cloud-native. 

## Dubber Pty Ltd was founded in Melbourne, Australia in 2011. The company was last funded by the post-IPO Equity Fund and raised $110 million.

## Companies core business activities include unified and compliant conversational recording. Unified Conversational Recording facilitates the capture, storage and centralisation of every voice, video, text, chat and more, across Telephony, Mobile, VoIP, Contact Centre and any communication device or end-point. Central to this is the evolution of hyperscale capture and storage - and the unification of data by person, team and company.

## Compliant call recording solutions, Revenue intelligence by resolving disputes with certainty, People intelligence by providing visibility into employee sentiment, wellbeing and performance, and customer intelligence by offering real time customer experience data from every conversation provides a vital lens into what’s working and what isn’t. Resolve disputes faster based on what was said. Enhance customer data sets with an accurate record of conversations.

## Dubber allows service providers to create immediate revenue, differentiation and improved customer retention. Industry & Govt, Enterprise, Small & Medium Business, Financial Services, Government, Education, Healthcare, Legal are some of the company’s intended customers. Compliance obligations are forcing institutions to not only record conversations with customers, but also search the recorded data for potential breaches of the law.

## Dubber offers Unified Conversational Recording which allows recording for compliance. Advanced digital signal processing enables the company to provide exquisite transcriptions and advanced features such as automatic language detection that is not offered by any other provider.

## The move to the cloud has been a boon for Dubber and companies offering similar services because the voice recording product is secure, scalable and offers a significant saving compared to the old way of doing it.

## Some of the technologies the company is using are:

* Unified Conversational Recording

* Natural Language Processing

* Rich Meta Data Analysis

* Elastic Search

* Dubber AI

* Security & Compliance

* Dubber API - RESTful API

* Dubber Analytics

* Advanced Digital Signal Processing

* Transcription - True AI and NLP

## According to KPMG survey, the domain is likely to see double digit growth as it matures, and hot spots are emerging. To determine the market size, the survey pursued estimates for firms’ headcount, turnover and total funding raised, then draw conclusions from those to the overlooked population in order to develop industry and segment-level estimates.
 
 ## The Dubber operates in the RegTech domain of FinTech. About 66% of the RegTech sector provides its offerings through the cloud, with 56% of suppliers employing machine learning and 43% using predictive data analytics to illustrate patterns or forecast behaviours, and around 35% use natural language processing (NLP) to analyse regulatory content.
 
 ## The domain is fairly young, and it has been studied by the reputed firms such as EY, KPMG at length in industry publications. Considering the technologies used and the practical attributes of vendors’ solutions, the RegTech sector can be divided into five segments: 
 
* Profiling and DueDiligence

* Reporting and Dashboards

* Risk Analytics

* Dynamic Compliance

* Market Monitoring

## Listed below are some of the major companies in this domain.

* BigID

* Chainalysis

* ComplyAdvantage

* CyberGRX, Inc.

* Drata

* Elliptic

* Forter

* Mitratech

* Socure

* Ascent

* Eventus

## Dubber allows service providers to create immediate revenue, differentiation and improved customer retention. Keeping up with regulatory change, optimising capital and minimising conduct risk and investigations by regulators are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success.

## Various global telecommunications companies in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific have adopted Dubber as core network infrastructure. Dubber's Software-as-a Service offering eliminates the necessity for hardware and lessens required capital expenditure. The dubbers collaboration with such companies ensures its bright future.

## Dubber is already offering various services and solutions in the market and there is a ‘Notes’ service to be delivered in the pipeline. This service will be able to transform the call, interaction and meeting into actions, and turn these actions into automated workflows providing insightful summaries and empower meaningful collaboration with curated prebuilt templates. 

## Along with this I think the Dubber should also offer integrated admin services solutions such as calendar management, diary management which will save a big chunk of customers time and improve productivity. This solution will enable users to see, add, and modify upcoming events.

## Currently there are no other provider which provides these many services at one place (unified services). Winner of RegTech Award 2021 (Best cloud technology supplier), Dubber incorporates this service as well in their portfolio, I believe they will be ahead of others in their domain. I believe this additional service would utilize Calendar API technology. This technology should be easily compatible with both the mobile and web apps.
